In this README file I will discuss each and every assignment and the Final Project that I am sumbitting

Project Title:-Data Science

Duration:-3 june-3 august(2 months) 

Tech Stack / Tools Used:-Anaconda Navigator,jupyter notebook,Google colab,pycharm

Assignment and project Description:-

Week1:-Print the Triangle pattern

Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

The primary goal for Week 1 was to understand and implement basic pattern generation using loops and conditionals in a programming language. The following patterns were created using the * character:
Lower Triangular Pattern
Upper Triangular Pattern
Pyramid Pattern

Task1:-https://github.com/SouhardyaBanerjee/Celebal_Data_Science/blob/main/Assignment%201.ipynb 

Week2:-Implement a Linked List in Python Using OOP and Delete the Nth Node

Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.

In this task, a Singly Linked List is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. This includes defining a Node class to represent individual elements and a LinkedList class to manage and manipulate the list.

Features Implemented:-

Node creation using a Node class
Linked list creation and management using a LinkedList class
Add a node to the end of the list
Print all nodes in the list
Delete the nth node from the list (1-based index)
Exception handling

Deleting from an empty list

Deleting a node with invalid index

Week6:-Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. Analyze the results to select the best-performing model.
