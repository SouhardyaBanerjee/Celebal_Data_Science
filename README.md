In this README file I will discuss each and every assignment and the Final Project that I am sumbitting

Project Title:-Data Science

Duration:-3 june-3 august(2 months) 

Tech Stack / Tools Used:-Anaconda Navigator,jupyter notebook,Google colab,pycharm

Assignment and project Description:-

Week1:-Print the Triangle pattern

Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

The primary goal for Week 1 was to understand and implement basic pattern generation using loops and conditionals in a programming language. The following patterns were created using the * character:
Lower Triangular Pattern
Upper Triangular Pattern
Pyramid Pattern

Task1:-https://github.com/SouhardyaBanerjee/Celebal_Data_Science/blob/main/Assignment%201.ipynb 

Week2:-Implement a Linked List in Python Using OOP and Delete the Nth Node

Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.

In this task, a Singly Linked List is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. This includes defining a Node class to represent individual elements and a LinkedList class to manage and manipulate the list.

Features Implemented:-

Node creation using a Node class
Linked list creation and management using a LinkedList class
Add a node to the end of the list
Print all nodes in the list
Delete the nth node from the list (1-based index)
Exception handling

Deleting from an empty list

Deleting a node with invalid index

Task3:-https://github.com/SouhardyaBanerjee/Celebal_Data_Science/blob/main/Assignment%203.ipynb

Week4:-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on a complex dataset. Focus on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables. Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support your findings.

The goal of this task was to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a complex real-world dataset to:
Understand data distributions
Identify missing values
Detect outliers
Uncover relationships between key variables

Dataset:-https://github.com/SouhardyaBanerjee/Celebal_Data_Science/blob/main/titanic_train.csv

Task4:-https://github.com/SouhardyaBanerjee/Celebal_Data_Science/blob/main/Assignment%204.ipynb

Week5:-House Price Prediction

Data Preprocessing and feature engineering
Resources :
