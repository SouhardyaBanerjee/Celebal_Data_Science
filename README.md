In this README file I will discuss each and every assignment and the Final Project that I am sumbitting

Project Title:-Data Science

Duration:-3 june-3 august(2 months) 

Tech Stack / Tools Used:-Anaconda Navigator,jupyter notebook,Google colab,pycharm

Assignment and project Description:-

Week1:-Print the Triangle pattern

Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

The primary goal for Week 1 was to understand and implement basic pattern generation using loops and conditionals in a programming language. The following patterns were created using the * character:
Lower Triangular Pattern
Upper Triangular Pattern
Pyramid Pattern

Week2:-Implement a Linked List in Python Using OOP and Delete the Nth Node

Create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Your implementation should include the following: A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.

In this task, a Singly Linked List is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. This includes defining a Node class to represent individual elements and a LinkedList class to manage and manipulate the list.

Week3:-Data Visualization

Take Any dataset of your choice and do the visualization

The goal of this task was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create meaningful data visualizations using a real-world dataset. The Titanic dataset was chosen for this exercise due to its simplicity and richness in features for analysis.
